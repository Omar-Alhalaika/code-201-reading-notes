# How the Web Works

## In four steps:
* When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com.

* Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.
* The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested.
* The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.

# `Structure`

## Structure, markup, Tags and elements

* HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the
Structure of Pages.

## we need to
* Understanding structure
* Learning about markup
* Tags and elements

Let's look closer at the code from the last page.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

## Attributes Tell Us More About Elements

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

  ## `Summary Structure`

 * HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# `Extra Markup`

## Different versions of HTML, Identifying and grouping elements, Comments, meta information and iframes

* we use some charcter to Escape Characters that are reserved by html code <br>
like to write a left angled bracket &lt;,
you can use either `&lt;` or
`&#60;`. For an ampersand, you
can use either `&amp`; or `&#38;`. 

* When using escape characters,
it is important to check the
page in your browser to ensure
that the correct symbol shows
up. This is because some fonts
do not support all of these
characters and you might
therefore need to specify
a different font for these
characters in your CSS code.

# `Summary`

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
`<!-- and -->` markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.


# `HTML5 Layout`

## Elements, Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS.

1. The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

2.  The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple `<div>` elements).

3. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

4. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.




# `Process & Design`

## Building a site, How to present information visitors want to see:


## First of all the Site Maps

    The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.
To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.
This involves placing each
piece of information that a
visitor might need to know on
a separate piece of paper and
then organizing the related
information into groups.
Each group relates to a page and,
on larger sites the, pages can in
turn can be grouped together to
create different sections of the
website.

## Some Summary to help

`PROCESS & Design`
* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

# The ABC of programming 

>  What is a script & how to creat one:

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.


* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.


* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.


* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
