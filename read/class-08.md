# Layout

* design layout refers to the way in which we arrange the elements on a page which makes up the content of a design.
*  The aim of layout is both to convey the message correctly and to present information in a logical, coherent way making the important elements stand out.

## positioning schemes

1. Normal flow
>Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside,
they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).
2. Relative Positioning
>This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.
3. Absolute positioning
>This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.
4. Fixed Positioning
>This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.
5. Floating Elements
>Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.

## Summary:

1. > `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

2. > Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

3. > The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

4. > Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

5. > Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

6. > Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

7. > CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

8. > You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
