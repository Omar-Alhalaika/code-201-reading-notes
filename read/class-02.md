## Semantic Markup

### Abbreviations & Acronyms

> `<abbr>`

If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the `<abbr>`
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.
In HTML 4 there was a separate
`<acronym>` element for
acronyms. To spell out the full
form of the acronym, the title
attribute was used (as with the
`<abbr>` element above). HTML5
just uses the `<abbr>` element
for both abbreviations and
acronyms.

### Auth or Details

> `<address>`

The <address> element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.
It can contain a physical address,
but it does not have to. For
example, it may also contain a
phone number or email address.
Browsers often display the
content of the <address>
element in italics.
You may also be interested in
something called the hCard
microformat for adding physical
address information to your
markup.

* HTML elements are used t XX o describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).


# Lists

## Numbered lists, Bullet lists, Definition lists

## OL

## Summary:

>There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.

> Ordered lists use numbers.

> Unordered lists use bullets.

> Definition lists are used to define terminology.

> Lists can be nested inside one another

## Links
  >Writing Links

  Links are created using the` <a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Introducing CSS

> lement as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

> Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

> Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

> Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

> CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Defining functions
### Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

## Loop
### JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
>for - loops through a block of code a number of times.

>for/in - loops through the properties of an object.

>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.

>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
