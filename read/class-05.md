## Image 

The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

## Color

1. Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
2. There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
2. Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
2. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
2. CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
2. CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

Colors are very important to give a good look and feel to your website. You can specify colors on page level using `<body>` tag or you can set colors for individual tags using bgcolor attribute.

> The `<body>` tag has following attributes which can be used to set different colors −

1. bgcolor − sets a color for the background of the page.

2. text − sets a color for the body text.

3. alink − sets a color for active links or selected links.

4. link − sets a color for linked text.

There are following three different methods to set colors in your web page −

1. Color names − You can specify color names directly like green, blue or red.

2. Hex codes − A six-digit code representing the amount of red, green, and blue that makes up the color.

3. Color decimal or percentage values − This value is specified using the rgb( ) property.
